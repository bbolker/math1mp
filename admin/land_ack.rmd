title: "land acknowledgement"

I would like to begin by acknowledging that the land on which we gather is the traditional territory of the Haudenosaunee and Anishnaabeg. This territory is covered by the Upper Canada Treaties, is within the lands protected by the “Dish With One Spoon” wampum agreement and is directly adjacent to Haldiman Treaty territory.
