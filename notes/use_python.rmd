Here are some ways to get started with Python, either online or by installing it on your own computer. The two recommended options are to [use the online servers provided](#syzygy) or to [install `Anaconda` on your own machine](#anaconda).

### Registration

1. Go to https://codelab4.turingscraft.com/register
3. Follow the directions, including verifying that you're not a robot and that your email address is valid. **enter your @mcmaster.ca email address, not your personal  email address! Your CodeLab grades will not be recorded unless you use your @mcmaster.ca email address** ![skull](../notes/pix/skullcross_tiny.png)
4. After registering, close all windows, exit the browser, re-open the browser and log in to CodeLab at https://codelab4.turingscraft.com/login
5. Click on the  "Add a Course" button in the courses area
6. enter the Section Access Code: **MCMA-27300-LJBG-42** and click `Next>` and confirm.
7. Fill in the Alternate ID field with your MacID (letters+numbers, e.g. `smithj1`) and click `Next>`. **You must correctly enter your macid at this stage.**
8. After clicking on the terms of service agreement you will be able to navigate to the 1MP3 course content.

### Log in

1. Go to https://codelab4.turingscraft.com/login
3. the **username** is the email address given during registration
4. the **password** is the password selected during registration

### Getting full access

1. Log in to CodeLab (if you haven't already)
2. Click the green  `Go` button next to this course
3. Click on the upgrade link shown in a beige band at the top of the window; follow the subsequent directions.
4. Follow the payment directions (options include PayPal/credit card, money order, and payment keys). The cost is US$25.

### notebook 

The very simplest way to use Python is to go to http://mcmaster.syzygy.ca, log in with your MacID and password, and open a new "Python 3" notebook.

### script + console window

If you want to use a script + console interface (this will be explained in class and tutorial), go to http://mcmaster.syzygy.ca/jupyter/user-redirect/lab, then:

- `File` > `New` > `Text File`
- right-click or shift-click on "untitled.txt" in the left-hand file bar: `Rename` the file to `<myfile>.py` (where `<myfile>` is whatever you want to name your script, e.g. `week1_stuff.py`). (Do **not** include spaces or punctuation other than `_` in your file name.)
- Go to `File` > `New Console for Editor`, open a "Python 3" console
- Rearrange your windows so that you can see the editor window and console at the same time.

## On your own computer (recommended): `Anaconda`

`Anaconda` is a complete Python "stack" (i.e., a set of programs and utilities) that has everything you will need for the class, including `Spyder` (a script + console environment) and a way to run notebooks.

### Installation

- Determine your platform
     - Mac OSX/Linux
	      - run `uname -m` in the Terminal (to open a terminal on the Mac, type `Command-Shift-u` to open Utilities; type `t` to select `Terminal`; double-click to open the terminal [or type `Command-Option-o`])
          - `x86_64` means "64-bit", `i686` means "32-bit" (if you have to guess, it's likely that you have a 64-bit version)
     - Windows: go [here](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/which-operating-system), follow instructions for your version of Windows
- Install Anaconda with Python `r minor_version` for your platform / architecture from here: http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/ (includes Spyder and a jupyter notebook server)

**note**: During the installation process you can skip the "Install Microsoft VS Code" step.

### Running Spyder

- open the "Anaconda navigator" on your computer and select Spyder ("Launch")
- or, search for the Spyder executable/application on your computer

### Running notebooks

- open the "Anaconda navigator" on your computer and select jupyter notebook ("Launch"); click on `New > Python3`

If you're new to computing and not interested in other nuts and bolts, you can stop here!

## Alternative 1: Python  `r major_version` + text editor

If you’re running Linux or Mac OSX and are comfortable in the terminal, you can get the basic Python `r major_version` stack and use your favourite text editor to work with `.py` files.

### Installation

- [Download the Python `r minor_version` installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Run the installer
-  ... that’s it

- [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) is a great editor, and has some built-in Python support (syntax highlighting + running scripts).
- [other text editors with Python support](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors)

**Note:** the installer will also install the latest version of Python 2, which will be the default if you run it from the terminal using `python`. To avoid this either run python using `python3` or make an alias in your `.bash_profile` from python to the Python `r major_version` executable.

## More alternatives: other IDEs

Some [recommended Python IDEs](https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments). These all require you to install Python separately, so you will also have to install Anaconda or vanilla Python 3.

### Yet more alternatives

Really you just need some combination of Python stack (Python/Anaconda) and something to edit **plain** text with. Heck, you can even use [`vi`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) if you're into that sort of thing. Do **not** use a regular [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) text editor like MS Word: you will be opening yourself up to a world of pain.

## Miscellaneous

### Python version checking

You can check what version of Python you are using by running [this](code/py_version.py) script or by running

```
python -c "import sys; print(sys.version)"
```

directly from Terminal.


### Package installation

Anaconda should come with all the packages you will need for this course. To install a Python package on Linux/OSX you can use `pip3` (for Python `r major_version`) as follows:

```
pip3 install "numpy"
```

for example, to install the [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) package. Replace `numpy` with whatever package you need.
