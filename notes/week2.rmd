# Conditionals and flow control

* **Conditionals**: Do something *if* something else is true
* **Flow control**: Go to different places in the code: especially, repeat calculations
* Everything we need for interesting programs (["the rest is commentary"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillel_the_Elder))
* Technically we can compute *anything*: [Turing machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) ([xkcd](http://xkcd.com/205/))

# Conditionals

* Do something *if* something is true
* `if` statement ([reference](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html)
```{r if1}
if False:
    print("no")
```
* else-if (`elif`) and `else` [clauses](http://xkcd.com/764/)
```{r if2,eval=FALSE}
if (x<=0):
    print("what??")
elif(x==1):
    print("one")
elif(x==2):
    print("two")
else:
    print("many")
```
* not too much else to say
* we can do more than one thing; use a *code block*

**example**

## while 

* repeat code many times, *while* some logical statement is true
([reference](http://python_while_loop.jpg))

For example:
![while loop](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/images/python_while_loop.jpg)
```{r while1}
x = 17
while x>1:
    x = x/2
```

Maybe we want to know how many steps that took:
```{r while1B}
x = 17
n = 0
while x>1:
    x = x/2
    n = n+1
```

* **What is the answer?**
* Can you get the same answer using `import math` and `math.log(x,2)` (and maybe `round()` or `math.floor`)?

* We can use logical operators to combine

```{r while1C}
x = 17
n = 0
while x>1 and n<3:
    x = x/2
    n = n+1
```


## for loops

* what if we want to repeat a fixed number of times?  We could use something like

```{r while2,eval=FALSE}
n = 0
while n<n_max:
    # do stuff
    n = n+1
```

Or we could use a `for` loop:

```{r for1,eval=FALSE}
for n in range(0,n_max):
    # do stuff
```

* does this repeat `n_max` or `n_max+1` times? (hint: try it out, and/or use `list(range(...))` ...)

* more generally, we can use `for` to iterate over *any list*: for example, we can write a change-writing program.

```{r intdiv}
total=5.73
toonies = 5.73 // 2 ## integer division
total = total - 2*toonies
```

```{r change,eval=FALSE}
total = 5.73
res = []   # empty list
denoms = list(2,1,0.25,0.1,0.5)
for d in denoms:
    # do stuff
```

Write a program to make change.

Let's look at the [Mandelbrot program](../code/mandelbrot.py) again ...

(add lots of examples)
