# Conditionals and flow control

- **Conditionals**: Do something *if* something else is true
- **Flow control**: Go to different places in the code: especially, repeat calculations
- Everything we need for interesting programs (["the rest is commentary"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillel_the_Elder))
- Technically we can compute *anything*: [Turing machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) ([xkcd](http://xkcd.com/205/))

# Conditionals

- Do something *if* something is true
- `if` statement ([reference](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html))
```{r if1}
if False:
    print("no")
```
- else-if (`elif`) and `else` [clauses](http://xkcd.com/764/)
```{r if2,eval=FALSE}
if (x<=0):
    print("what??")
elif(x==1):
    print("one")
elif(x==2):
    print("two")
else:
    print("many")
```
- not too much else to say
- we can do more than one thing; use a *code block*
- indentation is crucial

**examples**:

- [CodingBat date_fashion problem](http://codingbat.com/prob/p129125)
- [CodingBat alarm clock problem](http://codingbat.com/prob/p119867)

## while 

- repeat code many times, *while* some logical statement is true
([reference](http://python_while_loop.jpg))

For example:
![while loop](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/images/python_while_loop.jpg)
```{r while1}
x = 17
while x>1:
    x = x/2
```

Maybe we want to know how many steps that took:
```{r while1B}
x = 17
n = 0
while x>1:
    x = x/2
    n = n+1
```

- **What is the answer?**
- Can you get the same answer using `import math` and `math.log(x,2)` (and maybe `round()` or `math.floor`)?

- We can use logical operators to combine

```{r while1C}
x = 17
n = 0
while x>1 and n<3:
    x = x/2
    n = n+1
```

## for loops

- what if we want to repeat a fixed number of times?  We could use something like

```{r while2,eval=FALSE}
n = 0
while n<n_max:
    # do stuff
    n = n+1
```

Or we could use a `for` loop:

```{r for1,eval=FALSE}
for n in range(0,n_max):
    # do stuff
```

- does this repeat `n_max` or `n_max+1` times? (hint: try it out, and/or use `list(range(...))` ...)

- more generally, we can use `for` to iterate over *any list*.

![for loop](http://courses.cs.ut.ee/2011/programmeerimine/uploads/Raamat/_images/flowchart_for.png)

For example, we can write a change-writing program.

```{r intdiv}
total=5.73
toonies = 5.73 // 2 ## integer division
total = total - 2*toonies
```

```{r change,eval=FALSE}
total = 5.73
res = []   # empty list
denoms = list(2,1,0.25,0.1,0.05)
for d in denoms:
    # do stuff
```

- start with `total`, use `denoms` above

1. program to see how many pennies are left (how could we do this much more easily?)
2. **or** print out change as we go along
3. **or** save results as an array

Now let's look at the [Mandelbrot program](../code/mandelbrot.py) again ...

### Pythonicity

From [Secret Weblog](http://blog.startifact.com/posts/older/what-is-pythonic.html):

```{r pyloop1,eval=FALSE}
i = 0
while i < mylist_length:
   do_something(mylist[i])
   i += 1  ## or i=i+1
```

vs.

```{r pyloop2,eval=FALSE}
for i in range(mylist_length):
   do_something(mylist[i])
```

vs.

```{r pyloop3,eval=FALSE}
for element in mylist_length:
   do_something(element)
```

**Criteria**:

- speed 
- memory use
- simplicity (code length)
- simplicity (avoid modules)
- simplicity (avoid abstractions)
- pythonicity
