- math users vs. understanders vs. developers
- develop conjectures; draw pictures; write manuscripts
- mathematical proof (e.g. [four-colo(u)r theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem) and [other examples](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1084230/what-are-some-theorems-that-currently-only-have-computer-assisted-proofs)); computer algebra
- applied math: cryptography, tomography, logistics, finance, fluid dynamics, ...

- discrete vs. continuous math

## Fun!

**Hello, world** (always the first program you write in a new computer language)

```{r opts,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library("knitr")
## ## leave out runr (persistent python session) until
## ##  hash issue 
## library("runr")
## py <- proc_python()
## py$start()
## knit_engines$set(python = function(options) {
##     knitr:::wrap(py$exec(options$code), options)
## })
opts_chunk$set(tidy=FALSE,engine='python',engine.path='python3')
```

```{r hello_world}
print('hello, python world!')
```

Python as a fancy calculator:
```{r calc}
print(62**2*27/5+3)
```

## Interlude: about Python

- [programming languages](http://crashworks.org/if_programming_languages_were_vehicles/)
    - Python: [scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language); high-level; glue; general-purpose; flexible
    - contrast: *domain-specific* scripting languages (MATLAB, R, Mathematica, Maple)
	- contrast: *general-purpose* scripting languages (Perl, PHP)
	- contrast: general-purpose *compiled* languages (Java, C, C++) ("close to the metal")
- relatively modern (1990s; Python 3, 2008)
- currently the [5th most popular computer language](http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html) overall (up from 8th in 2015); [most popular for teaching](http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-universities/fulltext)
- well suited to mathematical/scientific/technical ([NumPy](http://www.numpy.org); [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org); [Python in Finance](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/python-for-finance/9781491945360/ch01.html))
- ex.: [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org); [BioPython](http://www.biopython.org)

### the "prime walk" (from [math.stackexchange.ca](http://tinyurl.com/primewalk))

1. start at the origin, heading right, counting up from 1
2. move forward one space, counting up, until you find a prime
3. turn 90${}^\circ$ clockwise
4. repeat steps 2 and 3 until you get bored

(example)

**Note**:

- easier to understand/modify than write from scratch
- build on existing components (*modules*)

## Interfaces

- command line/console (PyCharm: `Tools/Python Console`)
- programming editor
- integrated development environment (IDE)
- **not** MS Word! ![skull](pix/skullcross_tiny.png)

### Features

- syntax highlighting
- bracket-matching
- hot-pasting
- integrated help
- integrated debugging tools
- integrated project management tools

- **most important**: maintain reproducibility; well-defined **workflows**

## Assignment and types (PP $\S2.4$)

- superficially simple
    - set aside *memory* space, create a symbol that *points to* that space
    - `=` is the **assignment operator** ("gets", not "equals")
	- `<variable> = <value>`
	- variable names
         - what is legal? (names include letters, numbers, underscores, must start with a letter)
	     - what is customary? [convention](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id30) is `variables_like_this` ("snake case")
	     - what works well? `v` vs. `temporary_variable_for_loop`
		 - same principles apply to file, directory/folder names
- variables are of different [**types**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html)
     - built-in: integer (`int`), floating-point (`float`), complex, **Boolean** (`bool`: `True` or `False`),
     - *dynamic* typing
	     * Python usually "does what you mean", converts types when sensible
	 - (relatively) *strong* typing
         - try `print(type(x))` for different possibilities (`x=3`; `x=3.0`; `x="a"`)
		 - *what happens if you try `x=a`?*
		 - **don't be afraid to experiment!**
```{r type_examples,eval=FALSE}
x=3
y=3.0
z="a"
q=complex(1,2)
type(x+y)  ## mixed arithmetic
type(int(x+y))  ## int(), float() convert explicitly
type(x+z)
type(q)
type(x+q)
type(True)
type(True+1) ## WAT
```
[^2](As [Dive into Python](http://www.diveintopython3.net/native-datatypes.html) says in a similar context, "Ew, ew, ew! Don’t do that. Forget I even mentioned it.")

## Arithmetic operators, precedence

- exponentiation (`**`)
- negation ("unary minus") (`-`)
- multiplication/division (`*`,`/`,`//`=integer division,`%`=remainder ("modulo"))
- addition/subtraction (`+`, `-` ("binary"))

Use parentheses when in doubt!

**Puzzle:** what is `-1**2`? Why?

## Logical operators (PP $\S5.1$)

- comparison: (`==`, `!=`)
- inequalities: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, 
- basic logic: (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- remember your truth tables, e.g. `not(a and b)` equals `(not a) or (not b)`

```{r logical,eval=FALSE}
a = True; b = False; c=1; d=0
a and b
not(a and not b)
a and not(b>c)
a==c  ## careful!
not(d)
not(c)
```


- **operator precedence**: same issue as [order of operations in arithmetic](http://xkcd.com/992/); `not` has higher precedence than `and`, `or`.  When in doubt use parentheses ...

From [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/prob/p120546):

> We have two monkeys, a and b, and the parameters `a_smile` and `b_smile` indicate if each is smiling. We are in trouble if they are both smiling or if neither of them is smiling. Return `True` if we are in trouble. 

```
monkey_trouble(True, True) → True
monkey_trouble(False, False) → True
monkey_trouble(True, False) → False
```

## String operations (PP chapter 4)

*reference*: [Python intro](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html) section 3.1.2

- Less generally important, but fun
- `+` concatenates
- `*` replicates and concatenates
- `in` searches for a substring
```{r strops,eval=FALSE}
a = "xyz"
b = "abc"
a+1  ## error
a+b
b*3
(a+" ")*5
b in a
```


CodingBat problems:

- [make_abba](http://codingbat.com/prob/p182144)
- [make_tags](http://codingbat.com/prob/p132290)

One more useful string operation: `len(s)` returns the length (number of characters)

# Lists and indexing (PP chapter 8)

*reference*: [Python intro](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html) section 3.1.3

## Lists

- Use square brackets `[]` to set up a **list**
- Lists can contain anything but usually homogeneous
- Put other variables into lists
- Put lists into lists! ("yo dawg ...")
- `range()` makes a **range** but you can turn it into a list with `list()`

- *Set up a list that runs from 101 to 200*
- *Make a list that  ... *

## Indexing and slicing

### Indexing

- Extracting elements is called **indexing** a list
- Indexing [starts from zero](http://xkcd.com/163/)
- Negative indices count backward from the end of the string   
(-1 is the last element)
- Indexing a non-existent element gives an error

![slicing](pix/string-slicing.png)

### Slicing

- Extracting (consecutive) sets of elements is called [**slicing**](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/explain-pythons-slice-notation)
- Slicing non-existent element(s) gives a truncated result
- Slicing specifies *start*, *end*, *step* (or "stride")
- Leaving out a bit goes from the beginning/to the end
- Slicing works on strings too!

```{r slice_ex,eval=FALSE}
x[:]        # everything
x[a:b]      # element a (zero-indexed) to b-1
x[a:]       # a to end
x[:b]       # beginning to b
x[a:b:n]    # from a to b-1 in steps of n
```

- generate a list of odd numbers from 3 to 15
- reverse a string?

### String slicing practice

- [first_half](http://codingbat.com/prob/p107010)

### Other list operations

- Lots of things you can do with lists!
- Lists are **mutable**
```{r list_mut}
x = [1,2,3]
y = x
y[2] = 17
print(x)
```
- *operators* vs. *functions* vs. *methods* `x+y` vs. `foo(x,y)` vs. `x.foo(y)`
    * list [*methods*](http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/programming_books/python_programming/python_ch14s07.html)
    * appending and extending:
```{r append}
x = [1,2,3]
y = [4,5]
x.append(y)
print(x)
```
```{r extend}
x = [1,2,3] # reset x
y = [4,5]
x.extend(y)
print(x)
```
Can use `+` and `+=` as shortcut for extending:
```{r operate}
x = [1,2,3]
y = [4,5]
z = x+y
print(z)
```

- `x.insert(position,value)`: inserts (or `x=x[0:position]+[value]+x[position+1:len(x)]`)
- `x.remove(value)`: removes *first* value
- `x.pop(position)` (or `del x[position]` or `x=x[0:position]+x[position+1:len(x)]`)
- `x.reverse()` (or `x[::-1]`)
- `x.sort()`: what it says
- `x.count(value)`: number of occurrences of `value`
- `x.index(value)`: first occurrence of `value` 
- `value in x`: does `value` occur in `x`? (or `logical(x.count(value)==0)`)
- `len(x)`: length
