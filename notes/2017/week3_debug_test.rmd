## Errors

### Types of errors

- **syntax errors** vs. **logic errors**

- [matrix sum program](../code/sum_matrix_good.py)

- failure modes from logic errors:
    - obvious failure
        -  program stops with an error partway through: [bad matrix sum #0](../code/sum_matrix_noinit.py)
        - Python crashes
        - machine crashes
		- program never stops (infinite loop)
    - wrong answer
	    - always vs. sometimes (obvious categories) vs. sometimes (mysterious)
		- obvious vs. subtle

Next section follows [this presentation](http://space.wccnet.edu/~pmillis/cps120/presentations/program_logic_errs.ppt)

-  infinite loops:
```{r infloop,eval=FALSE}
print("Please enter (y)es or (n)o")
cin = input()
while ((response != "y") or (response != "n")):
   print("Please try again")
```
- [infinite loop matrix sum](../code/sum_matrix_infloop.py)
- operator precedence mistakes, e.g. $\Delta \textrm{fahrenheit} = \Delta \textrm{Celsius} \times 1.8$
```{r FCconv,eval=FALSE}
fahrdiff = celsius_high - celsius_low * 1.8
```
- off-by-one error ("fencepost problem")
   -  ... more generally, **edge** or **corner cases**
- code incorrectly inside/outside loops: 
   - [bad matrix sum #2](../code/sum_matrix_bad1.py)
   - [bad matrix sum #3](../code/sum_matrix_bad2.py)
- array index error (outside bounds)

### Error messages

- error messages are *trying* to tell you something
- Google error messages (with quotation marks)

## Debugging

- *brute-force logic* (the [Feynman algorithm](http://wiki.c2.com/?FeynmanAlgorithm)): stare at your code, try to figure out what's wrong
- test cases: why is it failing in one specific situation?
- flow charts, *pseudocode*
- tracing (`print()` statements)
    - put print statements before and after `if` conditions
	- before and after loops
	- in places where you suspect something might go wrong
- interactive tracing
- debugging tools (breakpoints/watchpoints/watches)

### More broken code

- [weird ascending](code/ascending_weird.py)

## Searching for/asking for help

### Searching for help

- Google (or your search engine of choice)
- be as specific as possible

### Asking for help

- reproducible/minimal workable examples
- paste *code* rather than screenshots whenever possible
- right amount of context (sometimes hard to guess)
- "how to ask" ([StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask), [Eric Raymond's advice](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
     - what are you trying to do?
     - where have you looked?
	 - what have you tried?
	 - [lmgtfy](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+do+i+find+the+last+letter+of+a+string+in+python)
- browse/lurk in forums first!
- tone
- where:
    - forums
    - StackOverflow

## Testing

- Simplify, simplify, simplify
- Reduce the size of your problem
- Cases with easy/known answers
- **Corner** and **edge** cases
- Random tests ([fuzz testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing))
- Automatic testing framework: `nose`
    - built-in Python package
	- more on this later ...
- Test-driven development: write tests *first*!
