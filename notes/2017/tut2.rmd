Most of the following is from the [Python 3.5.1 Documentation Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html).

## Numbers

Recall that if you want to, you can use Python as a fancy calculator.

```{python}
>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> 50 - 5*6
20
>>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
5.0
>>> 8 / 5
1.6
```


#### Typing and Mathematical Operators

By default, integer numbers are stored as type `int`, decimal numbers as type `float`. Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and exponentiation (`**`) using integers will result in an `int`, but division will result in a `float` **no matter what**.

```{python}
>>> 2 + 2       # integer
4
>>> 2 * 3       # integer
6
>>> 2 ** 3      # integer
8
>>> 4 / 2       # float!!
2.0
```

Similarly, operations between an `int` and a `float` will always result in a `float`.

```{python}
>>> 2 + 2.0     # float
4.0
>>> 2 ** 3.0    # float
8.0
```

Integer division (discards the remainder) can be achieved using the `//` operator.

```{python}
>>> 4  / 2      # float
2.0
>>> 4 // 2      # integer
2
```

We can compute _just_ the remainder using the modulo (`%`) operator.

```{python}
>>> 5 % 2
1
>>> 8 % 4
0
```


#### Variables

We can save results using variables, like so.

```{python}
>>> width = 20
>>> height = 5 * 9
>>> width * height
900
```

Variable names must start with a letter, but may contain letters, numbers, and underscores

## Strings

Strings, which can be thought of as arrays of characters, are represented in Python between either single `'` or double `"` quotes.

```{python}
>>> "Hello, world!"
'Hello, world!'
>>> 'Hello, world!'
'Hello, world!'
```

Notice the internal representation is the same.

The `print()` function can be used produce nicer-looking output.

```{python}
>>> print('Hello, world!')
Hello, world!
```

#### Escaping

Some special characters must be 'escaped' by preceding them with `\`, which tells python to just treat what follows as a regular character. For example, quotes of the same type as those that enclose the string must be escaped so as to not accidentally end the string...

```{python}
>>> print("\"Hello, world!\", said Professor Bolker")
"Hello, world!", said Professor Bolker
```

... but other types of quotes do not.

```{python}
>>> print("'Hello, world!', said Professor Bolker")
'Hello, world!', said Professor Bolker
```

#### String Operators

Just like numbers, strings can be manipulated using operators.

The (`+`) operator can be used to concatenate (glue together) strings.

```{python}
>>> 'Py' + 'thon'
'Python'
```

The (`*`) operator repeats strings.

```{python}
>>> 3 * 'blah'
'blahblahblah'
```

And just like with numbers, order of operations is preserved.

```{python}
>>> 3 * 'blah' + 'ium'
'blahblahblahium'
```

The (`in`) operator searches a string for another string or substring, returning either `True` or `False`.

```{python}
>>> 'Py' in 'Python'
True
>>> 'gg' in 'Python'
False
```


#### String Variables

String variables work just like numerical variables.

```{python}
>>> prefix = 'Py'
>>> word = 'thon'
>>> prefix + word
'Python'
>>> prefix * 5 + word
'PyPyPyPyPython'
```

#### Indexing

We can retrieve individual characters or substrings from a string by using indices. Recall the following diagram from class.

![slicing](pix/string-slicing.png)

The top numbers show the indices counting forward, the bottom ones counting back. Notice that indexing from the front **starts at 0**. So if we wanted get the first character, we actually want the '0th' element.

Elements are retrieved using square brackets `[]` after a string or string variable.

```{python}
>>> name = 'Monty Python'
>>> name[0]
'M'
>>> name[1]
'o'
```

Similarly, we can index from the back using negative indices, starting at -1.

```{python}
>>> name = 'Monty Python'
>>> name[-1]
'n'
>>> name[-2]
'o'
```

#### Slicing

We can access ranges of elements using `[:]`.

```{python}
>>> name = 'Monty Python'
>>> name[0:5]
'Monty'
>>> name[6:12]
'Python'
>>> name[6:10]
'Pyth'
>>> name[-12:-7]
'Monty'
>>> 
```

Notice that the start element specified *is* included but the stop element is *not* included.

By default ranges are consecutive, i.e. `0:5` is `0,1,2,3,4`, but you can specify the *stride* using a second semicolon `:`, i.e. `0:5:2` is `0,2,4`.

```{python}
>>> name = 'Monty Python'
>>> name[0:5]
'Monty'
>>> name[0:5:2]
'Mny'
>>> 
```

If you leave the start element or stop element blank, it will default to the start or end of the string, respectively.

```{python}
>>> name = 'Monty Python'
>>> name[:5]
'Monty'
>>> name[6:]
'Python'
>>> name[:]
'Monty Python'
```

## Logic

#### Equality

Commonly, we need a way to compare values. We can do this using equality operators. The most used ones are equal to (`==`) and not equal to (`!=`).

```{python}
>>> 3 == 3
True
>>> 3 == 5
False
>>> 3 != 5
True
```

This work for strings too.

```{python}
>>> 'hi' == 'hi'
True
>>> 'hi' == 'py'
False
>>> 'hi' != 'py'
True
```
 
#### Inequality

We can also use inequality operators less than (`<`) less than or equal to (`<=`) greater than (`>`) and greater than or equal to (`>=`) to compare numbers, which works as you would expect.

```{python}
>>> 3 < 5
True
>>> 3 <= 3
True
>>> 3 > 5
False
>>> 3 >= 2
True
```

For strings, inequality operators do alphabetical comparison.

```{python}
>>> 'hi' < 'py'
True
>>> 'hi' > 'py'
False
>>> 'hi' <= 'py'
True
>>> 'hi' <= 'hi'
True
>>> 'hi' < 'hi'
False
```

#### Basic Logic

Basic logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not` work here too.

```{python}
>>> True and False
False
>>> False or False
False
>>> True or False
True
>>> not(True or False)
False
```

Note that 1 is equivalent to `True` and 0 is equivalent `False`.

```{python}
>>> 1 and True
True
>>> False or 0
0
```

## Lists

We can use lists to store values in an ordered arrangement.

```{python}
>>> a = [1,2,3]
>>> a
[1, 2, 3]
```

#### Accessing Elements

The can be accessed using the same syntax as strings.

```{python}
>>> a = [1,2,3]
>>> a[0]
1
>>> a[-1]
3
>>> a[0:2]
[1, 2]
```

They can store values of different types.

```{python}
>>> b = [1,2,'py']
>>> b[0]
1
>>> b[-1]
'py'
```

You can also put lists in lists. Be careful with this.

```{python}
>>> b = [1,2,3]
>>> b
[1, 2, 3]
>>> b[-1] = [4,5]
>>> b
[1, 2, [4, 5]]
```

#### Modifying Lists

You can append a **single** element onto the end of a list using `append()`.

```{python}
>>> a = [1,2,3]
>>> a
[1, 2, 3]
>>> a.append(4)
>>> a
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

If you give `append()` a list as its argument, you get a nested list.

```{python}
>>> a = [1,2,3]
>>> b = [4,5]
>>> a.append(b)
>>> a
[1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]
```

You can extend a list with another list by using `extend()`.

```{python}
>>> a = [1,2,3]
>>> b = [4,5]
>>> a.extend(b)
>>> a
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

You can also concatenate lists using the (`+`) operator of extend them using the (`+=`) operator.

```{python}
>>> a = [1,2,3]
>>> b = [4,5]
>>> a + b
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> b += a
>>> b
[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```

Note that in the above example `a + b` does not modify either `a` or `b`, but `b += a` **does** modify `b`.
