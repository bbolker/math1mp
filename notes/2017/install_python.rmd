Here are some common combinations of Python stack and/or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and/or text editor that you can use to get started writing/running/debugging your own Python code, with installation instructions for Linux/OSX/Windows.

***

## Recommended: PyCharm + Anaconda

The most straightforward option. PyCharm is a simple Python IDE that runs on all platforms. Anaconda is a Python distribution containing the core Python stack and a few (300+) of the most common/useful Python packages to save you from having to install them on an as-needed basis.

### Installation

#### Anaconda

* Determine your platform
    * Linux/OSX: run `uname -m` in the terminal
        * `x86_64`  -> 64-bit
        * `i686`    -> 32-bit
    * Windows: [go here](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/which-operating-system), follow instructions for your version of Windows
* [Download](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) installer for Anaconda with **Python 3.5** for your platform / architecture from
* [Install](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install) using the installer.

#### PyCharm

* [Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) the PyCharm **Community Edition** installer for your platform / architecture
* Run the installer

### Setup

* Run PyCharm from wherever you installed it
* [Add](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/ide_integration#pycharm) Anaconda's Python executable as a Python Interpreter

## Python 3.5 + Text Editor

If you're running Linux/OSX and are comfortable in Terminal, you can just get the basic Python 3.5 stack and use your favourite text editor to work with `.py` files.

### Installation

* [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) the **Python 3.5.1** installer
* Run the installer
* ...that's it

[Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) is a great editor to try out, and has some built-in Python support (syntax highlighting + running scripts).

[List](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors) of other text editors with Python support.

Note: the installer will also install the latest version of Python 2 **which will be the default** if you run it from terminal using `python`. To avoid this either run python using `python3` or make an alias in your `.bash_profile` from `python` to the Python 3.5 executable.

***

## Other IDEs

[List](https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments) of recommended Python IDEs. Note that these will require you to have the Python executable so you will also have to install Anaconda or vanilla Python 3.


***

## Other

Really you just need some combination of Python stack (Python/Anaconda) and something to edit **plain** text with. Heck, you can even use [`vi`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) if you're into that sort of thing. Do **not** use a regular [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) text editor like MS Word - you will be opening yourself up to a world of pain.

## Miscellaneous


### Python Version Checking

You can check what version of Python you are using by running [this](py_version.py) script or by running

`python -c "import sys; print(sys.version)"`

directly from Terminal.


### Package Installation

If you need to install a Python package on Linux/OSX you can use `pip3` (for Python 3.5) as follows

`pip3 install "numpy"`

which will install the [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) package, for example. Replace `numpy` with whatever package you need and it will be downloaded and installed auto-magically.
