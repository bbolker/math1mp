## If Statements

Conditionals, or selective code execution based on conditions, is critical to programming. The most common way to implement conditionality is by using `if` statements. In Python these look like

```{r}
if (condition):
    print("Condition is True")
```

The idea is the `print` statement will only by executed if `condition` evaluates to `True`. In practice this may look like

```{r , eval = TRUE}
x = 3
y = 5
if x < y:
    print("x =", x, "is less than y =", y)
```

Recall that Python is **indentation-sensitive**. If you want multiple instructions to be executed if an `if` statement evaluates to `True`, simply indent multiple instructions in a **code block**.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
x = 3
y = 5
if x < y:
    print("x =", x, "is less than y =", y)
    print("Further, the difference is", x - y)
```


#### Else If / Else

Sometimes we want something to happen if an alternative condition is `True`, or if none of the preceding conditions are `True`.

To test alternative conditions we use `elif` (short for **el**se **if**) statements.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
x = 3
y = 5
if x < y:
    print("x =", x, "is less than y =", y)
elif x > y:
    print("x =", x, "is greater than y =", y)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE}
x = 3
y = 2
if x < y:
    print("x =", x, "is less than y =", y)
elif x > y:
    print("x =", x, "is greater than y =", y)
```

To set a default condition if none of the previous conditions have been met, we can use an `else` statement.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
x = 3
y = 3
if x < y:
    print("x =", x, "is less than y =", y)
elif x > y:
    print("x =", x, "is greater than y =", y)
else:
    print("x =", x, "is equal to y =", y)
```

## For Loops

`For` loops provide an easy way to perform operations a set number of times. A common use case is to perform an operation involving multiple elements of a `list`.

Example: counting word lengths.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
for w in words:
    print(w, "is", len(w), "letters long")
```

Note that during the loop execution, the list `words` is iterated through, and `w` is set to the current element.

#### Ranges

Python provides an easy way to build sequences of numbers using the `range()` function.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

Note that `range(a)` with a single argument will produce a sequence from `0` up to but excluding `a`, so `0,1,2,...,a-1`. Also, `range()` will produce an `iterable`, not a list of numbers. 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
print( range(5) )
```

However the `list()` function can be used to convert a `range()` `iterable` into a `list`.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
print( list(range(5)) )
```

`range()` can be used to construct more complex sequences as well.

We can specify a different starting point.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
print( list(range(1,5)) ) 
```

We can also specify the stride (like with list slicing).

```{r, eval = TRUE}
print( list(range(0,10,2)) )
print( list(range(10,0,-1)) )
```

If you wanted to do something like the previous word-counting loop but needed more control or information, you can use `range()` and `len()`.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
for i in range(len(words)):
    print("Word", i, "is", words[i], "and is", len(words[i]), "letters long")
```

## While Loops

If we do not know how many iterations want a loop to run for, we can use a `while` loop.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
a = 0
b = 1
while b < 10:
    print(b)
    b_old = b
    b += a
    a = b_old
```

Note we can also use **multiple assignment**, a special Python feature.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
a, b = 0, 1
while b < 10:
    print(b)
    a, b = b, a + b
```
