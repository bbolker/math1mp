Resources
=========

This is a general list of interesting and/or useful Python materials. If you find useful stuff that isn't on the list, please suggest it to the instructor or the TA ...

## Books, tutorials, etc.

* the official Python3 documentation at [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/) is the most comprehensive option for everything that is part of the Python3 programming language
	* these can get a little technical, but they are the final word on what any function or class does
* [Python for Beginners](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) from the Python Software Foundation
* [Python Programming for the Humanities](http://fbkarsdorp.github.io/python-course/)
* [CodingBat](codingbat.com) is a good source of practice problems.  Make sure to click on the Python tab rather than the Java tab!

## Bits and pieces of documentation

* information on [operators](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm) (not [this kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-chH7BMgVI) of operator)
* Python [built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html)
* [R/Python/MATLAB dictionary](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/); [another one](http://hyperpolyglot.org/numerical-analysis)
* [Python Pedia](https://pythonpedia.com/)

## Other tools

* typing `help("topic")` in Python will give you information about any Python function, class, etc..  Unfortunately you have to know what to ask: for example, `help("power")` doesn't work but `help("pow")` does (because the Python function for raising a number to a power is `pow()`, not `power()`).
* [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) is a neat little tool that shows you what all your variables are doing as you move through a Python program. Be sure to choose Python 3 from the drop-down menu!
* [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) is another resource for developing and running Python in the cloud
* a handy [online Python3 interpreter](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_python3_online.php)

## Forums

* probably best to ask Python questions first on the [Github issues list](http://github.com/bbolker/math1mp/issues) for this class
* [StackOverflow "python"-tagged questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python) are a very good resource for *looking for answers* (However, I suggest that you **do not** ask questions there until you have (1) tried to get the answer locally [from me or the TA or a fellow student] and (2) read and absorbed the [advice on how to ask questions](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).)

## Misc.

* [Python programming projects archive](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/PracticeOfComputingUsingPython/)
